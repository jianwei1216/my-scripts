Something needs to be done. Something that will make it looks better.

1. Change some old, ugly arguments into options.
  In node add & del operations, change group & hostname arguments into option. Make it more clean.

2. Change config file format.
  Use unify config file format, either in simplejson style or in 'Key-Value' style.

3. Deal with backtrace condition in function afr_expand.

4. In afr_expand, transform the service into an raid1(or raid01), when expand a service of normal type(or raid0).
